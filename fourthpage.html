        <h2>What is Visual Kei?</h2>
        <p>Before discussing Madman's Esprit, it's important to understand what Visual Kei is. Many label VK as "the
            japanese
            equivalent of (goth/hair metal/emo/etc)" but this is incorrect, largely because VK is not a genre, but a
            fashion movement based around music. It began in the 80s, and when it started it was very similar to the
            Hair Metal we had here in the west. However, it has evolved to become a much different culture with a lot of
            expressive variety. Even though VK is not a genre, it is still helpful to refer to the bands involved as a
            Visual Kei Band, as most VK artists tend not to stick to one genre, unlike most other alternative scenes.
            This particular band is unique, however, as they are a Korean Visual Kei band. Most fans of the band do not
            describe MME as belonging to one particular subculture of VK, as they are a very unique band (both in the
            Korean music scene and in the VK scene). </p>

                <p>As a musical project, Madman's esprit has a long and storied history. It began as the solo project of
                    lead vocalist, Kyohu, in 2010. For many years it continued this way, and only this year (2024) did
                    Kyuho announce that his newest support members were becoming formal band members. Madman's Esprit
                    started as (of all things) a Black Metal project, with plenty of depressive themes as are often
                    synonamous with the genre. Today, Madman's Esprit borrows from Black Metal, Metalcore, Traditional
                    Korean Singing, and some European Influences to create a genre that Kyuho calls "Blackened Pop".
                    Kyuho once stated in an interview, however, that "both groups (metal and pop) are gonna hate that
                    name, I just like to piss people off". </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p> I have so much to say about why I love Madman's Esprit that I'm almost worried it won't fit here.
                    The Korean Metal Scene is a really small one, and for such a unique and emotionally powerful band to
                    emerge from such a small scene is really just amazing to me. Additionally, the band composes music
                    in 4 different languages (English, Korean, Japanese, and German), which is just insane. Kyuho often
                    speaks out about K-Pop and
                    VK bands tendency for parasocial relationships, and he has done a wonderful job as an artist
                    seperating him as a person from his art form. While plenty of MME's songs are heavy on the subject
                    matter, the disconnected nature of his art leads you to form your own interpretations in just the
                    best way. And their sound- you'll have to hear it in the links I'll put in the history section.
                    There's no band that sounds quite like them. </p>

        <!--disclaimer if needed-->
        <p><b>Madman's Esprit largely serves as Kyuho's creative outlet, and he has dealt with intense mental illness
                for some time. Not all of their music is negative, but it does get pretty dark at times. If you decide
                to seek them out, know that some of their music videos are much more explicit than what I can discuss
                here.</b></p>

        <p><b>I did some research for this section, but some of this is gonna be interpretive or opinion-based. As
                stated before, Kyuho makes a dedicated effort to seperate him and his art, and has only done a few
                english interviews.</b></p>
        <h2> Early History (Black Metal, Solo)</h2>
        <p>The early history of MME is fascinating to me. Because they are a Korean band (and one that remains pretty hush-hush about their personal lives), it's not easy to figure out how the band started. This lack of information makes the band all the more fascinating to me. Essentially, MME started as a very convential Black Metal project, with shrieking vocals, low quality audio- the works. Because Kyuho (at the time, the sole member of the project) spoke four languages, and the music reflected that,  it started to gain fans in more than just the Korean music sphere. It helps that MME largely existed on Youtube, a platform where global music like this florishes. While early MME is very intriguing and enjoyable to me- it's not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're not familiar with the black metal sound.</p>
