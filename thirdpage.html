            <h2 id="vk">What is Visual Kei?</h2>
            <p>Before discussing DEVILOOF, it's important to understand what Visual Kei is. Many label VK as "the
                japanese
                equivalent of (goth/hair metal/emo/etc)" but this is incorrect, largely because VK is not a genre, but a
                fashion movement based around music. It began in the 80s, and when it started it was very similar to the
                Hair Metal we had here in the west. However, it has evolved to become a much different culture with a
                lot of
                expressive variety. Even though VK is not a genre, it is still helpful to refer to the bands involved as
                a
                Visual Kei Band, as most VK artists tend not to stick to one genre, unlike most other alternative
                scenes.
                This particular band is considered to be of the "Angura Kei" or "Loud Kei" variety. Angura Kei is a
                Western
                label that basically means darker, more Western-alternative themes are present, and Loud Kei refers to
                more
                extreme metal with-in VK. </p>

                    <p>DEVILOOF is a Visual-Kei band from Kansai, Japan. They are often considered to be the heaviest
                        band
                        in VK, as they are the only well-publicized VK band to tackle more extreme metal genres like
                        Slam
                        Metal. Modern DEVILOOF mainly focuses on more mainstream metal genres, like Metalcore,
                        Deathcore,
                        and Nu Metal. However, they have not lost their intense roots, with fans of the band often
                        citing
                        Vocalist Keisuke's inhuman (trust me- they're unbelievable) vocal techniques. Lyrically, they're
                        a
                        much more traditional metal band than something like Omerta or Madman's Esprit, but their mix of
                        English and Japanese helps them appeal to a wider audience, and is how I found their music
                        originally. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <p> DEVILOOF is one of my favorite bands for many different reasons. For starters, they introduced
                        me to
                        both Slam Metal and Visual Kei, which are two subcultures I actively follow today. Even more
                        pressing than that, however, is the fact that they simply do it like no other. Keisuke
                        (Vocalist) is
                        a beast behind the mic, and Ray (Guitarist, Vocals) has a beautiful voice to compliment
                        Keisuke's
                        aggression. The inclusion of VK tropes means that when a new album comes out, it's fun to see
                        what
                        each member's new outfit to go along with it is. Regretfully, being a japanese band means I have
                        yet
                        to see them live, but I strive to someday. </p>

            <!--history section with links-->
            <h2> Early History (Ishtar, Ruin)</h2> <!--first paragraph-->
            <p>The early history of DEVILOOF is a bit more uneventful than some of the other bands on this list, but
                there are still some things to discuss. For starters, DEVILOOF began their work as a slam metal band, a
                more extreme metal genre that is largely absent in other VK spheres. Basically, Slam metal is a faster,
                more intense version of death metal, to the point that people describe the "breakdowns" (point of the
                song where the bpm gets lower, for a "heavy hit") as "slams" instead, due to the intense bpm. After
                independently releasing two EPs with this sound (Ishtar and Ruin, respectively), the band has a bit of a
                shake-up in their lineup, resulting in the member responsible for this sound leaving the band. As the
                band shifted to a more permanent line-up, their first full-length LP was on the way. </p>

            <h2> Independent Albums (Return of the Curse, Oni, Dystopia) </h2> <!--second paragraph-->
            <p>This album would come to be Return of the Curse. Critically, Return of the Curse had a strange reception.
                Those with-in the VK community praised it as one of the heaviest releases in the scene. However,
                metalheads that were removed from the VK scene were critical of DEVILOOF's sound getting "softer", as
                they had pivoted from Slam Metal to Deathcore (Deathcore is modernized Death Metal, essentially). And
                although DEVILOOF's follow-up album called back to some of their heavier roots with tracks like
                Gouzinzangoku or Creepy, those who were mainly following DEVILOOF for their slam were still largely
                critical of the band- especially for the newer Guitarist's addition of clean vocals (vocals that aren't
                screams) on the two albums. To some metal fans, clean vocals ruin a band's reputation as a "heavy" band.

            <p>However, DEVILOOF was not simply pandering to a more accessible sound. In fact, like most VK bands,
                DEVILOOF never intended to stick with one genre from the beginning, something Keisuke (lead vocals)
                expresses with frustration in interviews often. Their next LP, Dystopia, serves to me as a bit of a
                testament to this fact. While some still argue over the genre of the LP, basically, a lot of their Slam
                influences from their early days are present on this record, and it is largely considered to be their
                heaviest release to date. Songs like Orwellian Society and Newspeak are full of Slammming breakdowns
                reminicent of their early work, and the album even features a 10 minute track titled "Disclosed
                Pandora's Box". If you can't tell, this is my favorite DEVILOOF record.</p>

            <h2> Current History (Label Signing, DAMN, Song for the Weak, Untitled)</h2> <!--third paragraph-->
            <p>This is probably the most controversial part of DEVILOOF's history. As of 2021, DEVILOOF has become
                signed professionally to a record label, and is no longer releasing their music independently. Many fans
                of the band point to this as DEVILOOF "getting softer" once more, but I personally disagree. While they
                have experimented with less extreme genres of metal since the signing, DEVILOOF is a VK band, which
                means experimenting with different genres is just part of the process. </p>
            <p>Since the signing, the band has released 2 EPs, with a third, untitled project coming out in 2025. The
                first of these two EPs is titled DAMN, and is where the band announced their signing. The title track of
                this EP is my favorite, with electronic elements that haven't been present in the band's music in the
                past. The second of these EPs is titled Song for the Weak, and is the most adventurous of the bands
                projects. The album features Nu-Metal influences, which is a genre that borrows conventions from rock
                and hip-hop to create a more mainstream sound (think Korn, Linkin Park, System of a Down). I would talk
                more about the third project, but not much is known yet.</p>

            <h3>If I like DEVILOOF, who should I check out?</h3>
            <p>My personal reccomendations for fans of DEVILOOF are DIR EN GREY, NOCTURNAL BLOODLUST, and Zera. For
                non-vkei reccomendations, I would probably reccomend Brand of Sacrifice or Within Destruction.</p>
