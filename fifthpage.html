                <p>Hail The Sun is probably the most well-known band on this website. They are a band from Los Angeles,
                    California. The most well accepted genre for the band is post-hardcore, although they've also been
                    referred to as experimental rock. They release music pretty consistently, and have 6 LPs and 3 EPs
                    to their name- the most infamous of these being their 2011 album "Wake", which is often considered
                    to be one of the most influential post-hardcore albums of all time. They formed in 2009 as a group
                    of friends from college.</p>

                <p> Hail the sun is unique in my favorites, as they are the only band that wouldn't really be considered
                    metal. I listen to a wide variety of genres, and Hail the Sun is probably the sole band responible
                    for that. When I first heard their EP Elephantitis, it felt fresh to me, like they were putting out
                    music that has something other bands didn't. They really made me feel more open-minded about the
                    genres I listen to, and are the reason that I started playing bass guitar. </p>

        <!--disclaimer if needed-->
        <p><b>Hail the Sun discusses a lot of cold cases in their music, so CW for depictions of real life crime and
                tragedies. Additionally, the singer often speaks on his battle with drug addiction, which the band was
                formed to combat.</b></p>
