                    <p>Hail The Sun is probably the most well-known band on this website. They are a band from Los
                        Angeles,
                        California. The most well accepted genre for the band is post-hardcore, although they've also
                        been
                        referred to as experimental rock. They release music pretty consistently, and have 6 LPs and 3
                        EPs
                        to their name- the most infamous of these being their 2011 album "Wake", which is often
                        considered
                        to be one of the most influential post-hardcore albums of all time. They formed in 2009 as a
                        group
                        of friends from college.</p>

                    <p> Hail the sun is unique in my favorites, as they are the only band that wouldn't really be
                        considered
                        metal. I listen to a wide variety of genres, and Hail the Sun is probably the sole band
                        responible
                        for that. When I first heard their EP Elephantitis, it felt fresh to me, like they were putting
                        out
                        music that has something other bands didn't. They really made me feel more open-minded about the
                        genres I listen to, and are the reason that I started playing bass guitar. </p>

            <h2> Early History (POW! Album, Elephantitis)</h2> <!--paragraph 1-->
            <p>Hail the Sun has always had a sort of "hidden gem" vibe to their music, and it's probably due to their
                obscure beginnings. The band started by releasing a home recorded album called POW! Right in the Kisser.
                The band, at this time, was a lot more technical and mathcore influenced then they are today, with some
                songs sounding more akin to something that The Fall of Troy would release, rather than the more
                mainstream rock influence they have adopted today. Even with the rough recording quality, POW! Right in
                the Kisser is one of my favorite albums of all time, with my favorite track being...</p>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/pz-FpR-pTFs?si=W0LMUsjAil62Opbi" target="_blank">Hail The Sun - Orion</a>
            <p>After the release of POW!, it would be two years before more Hail the Sun music was released. A
                kickstarter campaign for a professionally produced EP met their goal of 2500 USD, and the EP
                Elephantitis would release. Some fans cite this EP as their favorite ever release by the band- and I
                can't blame them. While only 4 songs in length, each track had an entirely different vibe to it, and
                some tracks are just mindblowing knowing that the singer was playing the drums live (he still does today
                ffor these specific tracks).</p>
