            <p class="column-1">This page will eventually have info for Omerta! Right now, however, the goal is to be an affront to the eyes of any viewer! I'm typing this out as longwindedly as possible because I know these colors tire the eye!!1!</p>
            <p class="column-2"> Seriously though, the info on Omerta shouldn't be hard. Their Discography is thirty minutes long. Isn't that kind of lame? At least their official website is a lot better made than mine is right now! I guess that's not hard....... </p>
